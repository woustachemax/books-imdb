2.  created a index.js in the routes folder for directing the user to different pages.
3.  created user route for user for signin/signup functionality. {Flow: export ruter from routes/index to index to direct calls from /api/v1 and same for user.js to routes/index.js to direct calls from /ap1/v1/users to user.js}
3.  created signin/signup routes, both post routes and encrypted them using jwt

### Day 2: Progress, well, not really day 2, but you know what I mean!
